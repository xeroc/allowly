Helius already on Solana Pay ecosystem - potential partnership opportunity. DEFI PROTOCOLS: Drift Vaults - $11.57M annualized fees, needs management fee distribution, Tributary can automate vault fee payments to managers, MEDIUM complexity. Cega - 2% management fee structure, perfect for recurring payment automation. GAMING: Solana Game Pass - $40K prize pools, season pass model ready for Tributary subscription automation, MEDIUM complexity. Star Atlas - gaming economy with recurring needs, potential for milestone payments. NFT MEMBERSHIPS: Opossum Posse - DAO membership with dividends, Tributary can automate recurring membership fees, LOW complexity. Solana Bear Gang - gaming platform with exclusive perks, subscription access model fits perfectly. PAYMENT PROCESSORS: Helio/MoonPay - acquired for $175M, existing merchant base, potential Tributary integration partnership rather than direct competition.","created_at":"2026-01-09T19:45:01.780Z","tags":"tributary,b2b-targets,solana-protocols,integration-analysis"}
